## About

The purpose of this project was to build a functioning e-commerce site to advertise property for sale or rent on the irish market with payments via [Stripe](https://stripe.com/).

The site allows users to create an account, and advertise a property or browse available properties. It is not necessary that users register to browse the site, however they do gain access to the ability to save properties they like if they do deicde to register. The site also allows social logins from two popular vendors for a convenient way to create an account.

## UX UI

-   Everything in the Client Brief was implemented, but not limited to just the brief, other features include

    -   There are filters in place which allows the user to filter properties to find one that matches their preferences easily. Coupled with a paginator which allows for a neat viewing experience.
    -   There is a contact form on the estate agents profile page which allows the user to send a message direct to an agents email which lets the agent know that the interest in the listing came from the mymo website. This page also displays the relevent information about the agent and their listings.
    -   The site allows users to save listings if registered and logged in.
    -   A signup/login form with social logins from two popular vendors.
